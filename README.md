This repository is intended for learning purposes: both to learn how to code in python 
and how to use github.

Please feel free to suggest changes to the code, it would help me greatly!

Description of this project:

        Python implementation of original Matlab code from:
        * Sedehi, Omid, et al. "Sequential Bayesian estimation of 
          state and input in dynamical systems using output-only measurements." 
          Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 131 (2019): 659-688.

        Implementation of Augmented Kalman Filter originally from Matlab code
        created by O. Sedehi, based on:
        * Lourens, E., et al. "An augmented Kalman filter for force 
          identification in structural dynamics." 
          Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 27 (2012): 446-460.
